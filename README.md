# Just Wheels Bouncing (JWB)
This is a simple physics engine for simulating frictionless circles colliding. I
hope to keep the user interface nice and simple. This is currently a
work-in-progress.

## Implemented features
 * Perfectly elastic collisions
 * Toroidal universe
 * Entity resource management
 * Friction with the surface

## Features planned
 * Partially elastic collisions
 * Walled universe
 * Bindings to other languages
 * Friction between circles?
 * Move geometric data to separate shared structures?
